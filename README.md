This repo consists of reading notes, code examples, and other material
I'm producing while reading Donovan and Kernighan, The Go Programming
Language (see http://www.gopl.io).

The code files in the chapter directories are either named `exn.m.go` or
without the leading `ex`.

Those without a leading `ex` are typed straight out of the text; the
code is all available from https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io. That
repo specifies that these example programs are licensed under a Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License:
Copyright 2016 Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan.
License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

Those in the chapter directories that do have names with a leading `ex`
are my own. It doesn't really seem worth the formal legal dance, but
there are offered under the GPL 3.0 or, at your option, a later version
of the GPL. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
